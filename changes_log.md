Revised the most recent configuration of my utilized vault framework on GitHub.

- Inclusion of Demo Vault 2
- Relocated the `/src` directory from within the `Demo Vault` folder (now designated as `Demo Vault 1`). This directory will serve as the designated location for storing attachments and files, regardless of the specific Demo Vault chosen.
- Transferred the `.obsidian` folder, serving as the configuration directory, from within the Demo Vault (now known as Demo Vault 1). This ensures uniform configuration settings across all chosen demo vaults.
- Eliminated the `Admotion` plugin, as the inherent features of Obsidian now encompass similar capabilities.
