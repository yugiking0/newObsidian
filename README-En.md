3. Copy this folder to your device:
   
   1. macOS, iPhone, iPad: Copy it to your Cloud service folder, you can use the default iCloud or OneDrive (what I'm using), or Google Drive.
   2. Windows: Copy it to the OneDrive or Google Drive folder, or any cloud app you choose. You can also choose not to use cloud if you don't want to sync with other devices. Just put it somewhere you can remember and open the Vault folder as Vault from Obsidian.
   3. Android: Put it in the root folder. You will need to use the FolderSync app to sync with the cloud if you want to.

Note: You need to install OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc., on your computer to sync data with mobile devices.
